    "[Vertex Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview) provides two different explanation types to better understand model decision making:\n",
    "- *Feature-based explanations* indicate how much each feature in the model contributed to the predictions for a chosen input instance. \n",
    "- *Example-based explanations* provide a list of examples (typically from the training set) that are most similar to the chosen input instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vertex Explainable AI can be used with a custom-trained model, an AutoML model, or a BigQueryML model. \n",

    "<br>You can easily see that typically happy words end up being attributed to positive scores and typically negative words are attributed to negative scores. The words *\"good\"* and *\"guaranteed\"* have a strong positive influence while the words *\"chuckles\"* and *\"rid\"* have strong negative influence. The model learned these associations in bulk from the review words and labels in our training set. Vertex Explainable AI further allows you to see specifically what the model learned, which can help you find potentially problematic scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this review, the word *\"black\"* appears in the phrase \"black comedy\", which is neither positive nor negative, just a type of comedy. The model, however, doesn't see *\"black\"* as a modifier to *\"comedy\"*. It is its own unique word. Across the rest of the dataset, *\"black\"* likely appeared in more negative reviews than positive reviews, which is why it got the negative attribution. Since this review is labeled and predicted as positive (typically showing predictions in the 90% range, depending on the random initialization undergone by your model), it likely mediated how negative *\"black\"* would have otherwise been. While this could be entirely coincidental, it could also point to biases in the data that you want to address. Further data exploration is definitely the next step!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, you have much more powerful language processing tools now with Generative AI! You can use not just single words, but the entire context to understand meaning. You could use [PaLM Text Embeddings](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/textembedding-gecko) to provide a vector representation of the entire review, rather than each word independently. You could then use a simpler dense (rather than recurrent) neural network to learn positive and negative scores from all of the context and nuance in the natural language!"
