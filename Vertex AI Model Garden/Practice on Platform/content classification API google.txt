1. Now you will explore content classification. Re-create the request.json file by executing the following commands:


rm request.json
nano request.json

2. Replace the code in request.json with the following statement:

  {
    'document':{
      'type':'PLAIN_TEXT',
      'content':'Googleâ€™s Plan for the Future of Work: Privacy Robots and Balloon Walls'
    },
    'classificationModelOptions': {
      'v2Model': {
        'contentCategoriesVersion': 'V2',
      }
    }
  }
  
3. Send the request to the API's classifyText endpoint by executing the following command:
curl "https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:classifyText?key=${API_KEY}" \
  -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json > result.json
  
4. Check the response type by executing the following command:

cat result.json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "/Science/Engineering & Technology/Robotics",
      "confidence": 0.22492509
    },
    {
      "name": "/News/Business News/Company News",
      "confidence": 0.2238491
    },
    {
      "name": "/News/Technology News",
      "confidence": 0.19114923
    },
    {
      "name": "/Internet & Telecom/Search Engines/Other",
      "confidence": 0.17344825
    },
    {
      "name": "/Science/Computer Science/Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence",
      "confidence": 0.10473869
    },
    {
      "name": "/People & Society/Social Issues & Advocacy/Other",
      "confidence": 0.10268368
    }
  ]
}
What do you notice about the results? Are any of the labels relevant to the problem at hand? The model does a great job classifying the article title into different categories, but it does not predict the publisher of the article as you hoped.

The model being called has been trained for a different set of labels than what you were looking for. To predict the labels that you desire, you can train a new model using AutoML. While AutoML is available through Model Garden, it is currently only for training tabular models. We will train our model from the provided dataset instead.
